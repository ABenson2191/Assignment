										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/MBTI.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									</header>
									<p>My result was Defender personality.<br />
									   Defenders are practical and dedicated. Known for their reliability and altruism, Defenders are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. Defenders dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.<br />
									   Defenders can be easily caught out in areas where their kindness and practical approach can be more a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding a partner, learning to relax or improvise, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or managing their workload, Defenders need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills.</p>

									<h1>What do these results mean for me?<br />
									</header>
								<p>What these results have indicated to me is that I am hands on person. I learn best when I am playing around with things, instead of someone telling how to do it. I am a reserved person that is very loyal and demanding of myself. I also must push myself out of my comfort zone to achieve the things that I want in life. I am very driven and determined to achieve the goals I have set for myself.</p>

											<h1>How do I think these results will influence my behaviour in a team?<h1>
											</header>
								<p>These results will influence me to be more proactive in my group. Not to just accept the norm but to push and challenge my team members in a positive way. Positive feedback pushes us all to be better and improve. My behavior in a team environment is very structured. I may find it frustrating if things are not completed by the dates set out by the group. The way I work is to be efficient with my time and when working in a team, everyone looks out for each other not themselves.</p>

											<h1>How should I take these result's into account when forming a team?<h1>
											</header>
								<p>When forming a team, I need to consider a few aspects of my test results. I am a very visual person so when people are communicating or describing things to me visual aids or graphs are very good tools. I am someone who has been brought up in team environments through sport, so having the defender personality is not a shock for me. I need to remember that some people prefer to work alone and won’t be forth coming. Different personalities will clash but ultimately this assignment is a group assignment and people will have to find a way to work together.</p>
