										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/MBTI.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									</header>
									<p>My result was Defender personality.<br />
									   Defenders are practical and dedicated. Known for their reliability and altruism, Defenders are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. Defenders dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.<br />
									   Defenders can be easily caught out in areas where their kindness and practical approach can be more a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding a partner, learning to relax or improvise, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or managing their workload, Defenders need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills.</p>

									<h1>What do these results mean for me?<br />
									</header>
								<p>The results of the personality and learning style tests have indicated to me that I am a practical and tactile learner who responds well to hands-on experiences. I learn best from the opportunity to problem solve and experience things for myself. I can be reserved however I am loyal. As I can have high expectations on myself, I need to be motived to move out of my comfort zone. This will ensure that I am able to achieve my short- and long-term goals. I am very driven and determined to achieve my personal goals.</p>

											<h1>How do I think these results will influence my behaviour in a team?<h1>
											</header>
								<p>In a group setting, I will need to ensure I am a proactive team member. I will need to think in an abstract manner and ensure that all team members are involved. I will be aware of the importance of positive feedback. On reflection, I am a very organized person and my approach to team work can be quite structured. It will be important for me to recognise the different personality types within the group to ensure that I am understanding. I am efficient with my time however may find it difficult when deadlines or expectations are not being met by others in the group.</p>

											<h1>How should I take these results into account when forming a team?<h1>
											</header>
								<p>When forming a team, I need to consider a few aspects of my test results. I am a visual learner so I may have a preference to using tools such as visual aids and graphs. Due to my defender personality, I can find it difficult to be flexible. This is something I will need to be aware of when working in a team to ensure that all team members ideas are heard and respected. Reflecting on my own personality and others around me will ensure that I am able to work well with people with a range of personality traits and learning styles for a common goal – the group assignment.</p>
