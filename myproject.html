									<h1>My Project<h1>
									</header>
									<p>Monitoring device for Critical Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) </p>
								<p>Technicians are required to carry out maintenance and services on numerous CRAC units with-in data centers. An interactive monitoring device for critical room air conditioning will take away the need for tools and meters on a maintenance or service. An intelligent device that analyses how a system is running will help the technician carry out an affective maintenance. This removes the technicians need to be exposed to live electrical components or moving parts. Furthermore, this eliminates hazards, creating a safer and more effective way for technicians to carry out services and maintenance. </p>
								<header class="major">
										<h1>Motivation<h1>
										</header>
										<p>During my apprenticeship, I was taught to work smart not hard. The need for quality and prompt information is essential in todays working environment. With this technology we can deliver quality information leading to better service. With IT we can drive refrigeration and air conditioning forward. I have seen people controlling entire mine-sites with the touch of a button. From Autonomous diggers to massive stackers all controlled by one person. So why not with CRAC units? Making my trade safer and more intelligent is my motivation for this project. </p>
							            <p>With new rules and regulations in place, live works cannot happen without major protective equipment i.e. a bomb suit. This makes it very difficult for a technician to take readings that ultimately determine if the system is running correctly or not. For example, to take an amperage reading, a technician is required to shut the unit down and then attach a clamp before placing the protective covers onto the unit and turning the system back on. This process can take a number of hours as each system has multiple readings a technician must take. This device will not only help make services quicker and safer, it will provide more detailed information and can prevent injury. </p>

											<h2>Software that will analyze and put together service reports for technicians without the need of tools or equipment.</h2>
											</header>
									    </p>The monitoring device will develop a service sheet at any moment; detailing how the system is running. The service sheet will show all the information that has been selected via the configuration page. The sheet will display graphs and diagrams of the temperatures and readings that have been programmed. This service sheet is a great professional tool that can be customizable to the unit’s needs. The machine will identify potential causes of the issue (if present) and recommended courses of action.</p>
										</ul>
									</article>
										<header>
										<h2>User friendly interactive screen<h2>
											</header>
										  <p>This screen will show all of the readings that the device is recording. The information that the device is displaying will be live and easy to read/understand. </p>
										</ul>
									</article>

												<h2>Remote monitoring via a network link that can clear alarms and change how the system is running.<h2>
										</header>
										</p>Many clients are in remote parts of Australia and it is expensive to get to site. With the use of this device, technicians can effectively see how the system is running and diagnose units from miles away. Technicians can respond quicker and give the client a clear response to the question - what is my machine is doing? Instead of having to travel on a plane and arrive at site the following day to diagnose the system, this device immediately puts the technician in-front of the machine diagnosing the issue.</p>
										</ul>
									</article>
										<header>
											<h2>Interactive Parts lists<h2>
										</header>
										<p>This connects the technician to the suppliers and allows them to order via the controller. They are required to enter a PO number and the controller will remember the pre-existing details to deliver the parts. The efficiency of this product will save countless hours chasing up parts. With this device we can see every spare part available along with cost and ETA of arrival. The device will automatically connect to the supplier’s website and keep up to date with pricing. If quoting is required, the device will deliver a detailed quote from the supplier to the technicians email to then be able to be sent to the relevant people to approve</p>
										</ul>
									</article>
									<header>
											<h2>Manuals will be stored on the controller and can be downloaded to any device with-in range<h2>
									</header>
									</p>The device will also store all of the machine’s manuals in one place. Technicians just need to connect the device to the monitoring device and the manuals will be downloaded to a phone, laptop or tablet</p>
									</ul>
								</article>
									<header>
										<h2>Immediate Response<h2>
									</header>
									<p>If a system is in alarm or nearing alarm conditions the system will alert technicians so they can respond immediately and effectively via the network or on-site. Alerts will be sent to the relevant company who look after the machines. With this technology we can catch issues before they affect the running of the data centers.

										<h1>Tools and Technology<h1>
										</header>
			                            <p>The technology required to carry-out this project has already been invented. The cost of some of these parts are expensive and require some labour to install. A small computer i.e. a raspberry PI is required to take all the readings from the inputs and interpret the information. To take the readings we would require transducers, amperage probes, temperature probes, voltage probes etc. Limitations would be the basic software currently available for A/C units. The software would have to be compatible with the various types of machine brands that are in use. The hardware is available however the software would have to be written<p>			
								<header class="major">
										<h1>Skills required<h1>
										</header>
										<p>For this project to be feasible, the software would have to be written. Monitoring software at this moment is not tailored to A/C units (not this in depth). The software must be able to analyze the system and effectively decipher when there is a problem or what the problem is. The system will have to stay connected to the internet and have adequate protection from hacking. In terms of hardware we will require a lot of components which could be expensive. A licensed refrigeration mechanic would be required to install the components. This project is feasible however it would require a lot of experience in software development</p>
								<header class="major">
										<h1>Outcome<h1>
										</header>
										<p>This device solves many issues that technicians currently working in A/C encounter. A technician can carry out an effective service without putting him/herself in the line of fire for an injury. This eliminates hazards and removes danger – this will save lives. Companies face less down time and save more money long term due to this intelligent device. Benefits include but are not limited to; detecting issues before they become a problem, quick fault identification, less time flying technicians to site, detailed service reports at the touch of a button</p>
