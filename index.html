										<h2>My interest in IT</h2>
										</header>
									<p>With my work, I get to travel Australia and maintain data centers for mining operations. By placing these centers on the ground, it allows a central hub in a major city to run multiple mine site's miles away. It is fascinating. Autonomous trucks to loaders and stackers. Massive machinery all controlled by one person in a chair mile’s away. Working around this environment has sparked an interest for me and I can't wait to learn more.</p>

										<h2>IT experience<h2>
										</header>
						              <p>I use technology every day from Bluetooth in my tools to connecting my laptop to A/C units using HyperTerminal. I have some minor networking skills that I have gained through my time in my trade.</p>
									</ul>

											<h2>Why RMIT?<h2>
									</header>
									<p>I chose RMIT because of two main reasons. One because of the reputation the university has built for itself. And two because I am able to complete a bachelor’s of IT without giving up my job that I love. I can advance my skills and become more desirable to my company.</p>
									</ul>

										<h2>What do I expect to learn?<h2>
									</header>
									<p>This course will develop my skills and further my understanding of networking and programming. I expect to learn the principles of programming and be able to confidently write my own code. I am hoping this course will give me the skills required to bridge a gap between my trade and information technology.</p>
